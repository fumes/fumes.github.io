Fumes project was started by two photographers. A metaphor to play with, delivering ideas via images.

Fumes are influencing our lives on a subliminal level.. just like the air we breathe.

Fumes slowly travel picking up and delivering the poetry within their journeys.

Fumes are non commercial, do not have a plan and move with the wind, yet we carry their essence within each of us.

Fumes are free, you can easily stop breathing 'em by moving past it upwind. Enjoy!

Check us out as we are updating fresh Fumes on a ... hum, volatile basis.

Now that you read the all thing 'till here, please consider writing us what's fuming in your head! Use comments, we'd def like to hear from you!
