Mediolanum ipsum est.

Quod a nobis factum est.

Sic ne ullus verbum neque ullus imago satis est. 
mediolanum (milano) ipsum (itself) est (is).

Quod (which) a (a) nobis (noble) factum (fact) est (is).

Sic (so) ne (not) ullus (any) verbum (word) neque (nor) ullus (any) imago (image)  satis (enough) est (is). 
Milano itself is.

Which is a noble fact.

So not any word or any image is enough.
