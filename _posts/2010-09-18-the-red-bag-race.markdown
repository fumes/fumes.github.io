Local kids flocked to check out the local surf contest. Organizers get these kids involved with a side event. A trash pick up race with the goal to win some product prizes.

Cleaning plastic pollution is a game. Kids are given a 10 minutes and a red bag. When time is up, they all line up with their hunt and got their moment of fame and free products.
