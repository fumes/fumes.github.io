"Women are Heroes" is a photography project by french photographer JR.

This work, which got viral, is about pictures made into huge posters and glued to public spaces.

Exposed in outdoor galleries on the streets and buildings "Women are Heroes" subjects are rural african women, framed in strong black and white close-ups.

The artist way of looking at landscape as an exibition territory is pretty elastic. His subjects are enlarged beyond the billboard size and glued on very visible walls.

JR reaches a huge impact by combining ultra tight cuts with huge prints of his human subjects.

Definitely undercover, photographer JR likes to keep his real name invisible and be known by his work.
