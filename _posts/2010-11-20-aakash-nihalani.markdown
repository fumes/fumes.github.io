"My street work consists mostly of isometric rectangles and squares.
I selectively place these graphics around New york to highlight the unexpected counters and elegant geometry of the city itself."

"All executions of a piece is done on site with little to no planning."

"People need to understand that hows it is, isn&rsquo;t how it has to be."

"My work is created in reaction to what we readily encounter in our lives."

"I&rsquo;m just connecting the dots differently to make my own picture."

"Others need to see that they can create too, connecting their own dots, in their own places."
