Pak Mat Djabin is a traditional javanese healer specializing in "Urut" massage.

Urut massage is perhaps the most sophisticated of all the Indonesian healing arts and can only be found in Bali and in Java, where the Majapahit Kingdom flourished and was influenced from Arab, Chinese and Indian traders.

It is certainly the most painful as it focuses on nerve pathways, pressure points and physically realigning and manipulating the anatomy.

Urut can be used to treat everything from soft tissue damage to even bone fractures.

Urut massage is very precise and technical, but to endure the discomfort of a treatment is usually beneficial, as the feeling of well-being is quickly restored after a treatment.

If you like Pak Mat will massage you with his wooden dildo.
