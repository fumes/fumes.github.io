Sepak Takraw is a sport popular throughout South East Asia.  

Fumes caught up with some fishermen in an afternoon pickup game in the Thai province of Krabi.

"Sepak", meaning "kick" in Malay, and "Takraw", meaning "ball" in Thai, is a simple and highly acrobatic sport.  

In this modern Sepak Takraw the court is the same size as a badminton court, the rules are the same as in volleyball, only using one's hands is not allowed.  

This is the new style Sepak Takraw, the traditional one is quite different. In the old way there are no teams competing, but players form a circle and help each other. The goal a very high basket-like target. Its all focused on style and control, on how acrobatic and peculiar your move is.
