The Mentawai people are an indigenous tribe of hunters who live deep in the jungle of Siberut Island, off the coast of western Sumatra.

They live in isolation by choice, rejecting modernity, religion and government pressures to assimilate into Indonesian society.

They do so in order to continue their ancient way of life in communion with the spirit and animal world of the rainforest.

Aman is a shaman, or healer who has sensitivities with the spirits.
