Some Thailand election posters are as big as this unfinished skyscraper.

Fumes is offering a glimpse of the styles and subjects used in campaigns during this general election. Fumes attempts to translate the various campaign slogans that reveal candidates' platforms and agendas.

In Thailand, the members of the House of Representatives get elected not by winner takes all, but by proportional representation. Since there are multiple parties on the ballot, voters are free to check as many boxes as they wish, either "yes" or "no".
