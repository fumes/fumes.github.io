Many Thai people sincerely love their King. Most houses or shops display at least one photo of His Majesty. Is it in a inexpensive calendar, inside a well framed photo or in the form of a watercolor portrait, King Bhumibol Adulyadej is there in the everyday life. The Royal celebration peaks on Father's day. December 5th, the King's birthday (currently 84 years old). 

Today most shops are closed and quiet celebrations are held countrywide. Restaurants, bars and events won't sell alcoholic drinks, that&rsquo;s why many stay closed. Centers, parks, hotels, and malls are adorned with all kinds of Royal images. Teaching about significant moments in the life of the Monarch or providing iconic examples.

People love to go snap their shots using the Royal Advertising as background. Posing with joined hands or popping their best smile and a peace hand sign. Those photos should be up on FB by now, showing love for the King Rama Nine. 

_Here is a visual voyage about the present Thai Royal soft power._

Something unthinkable in the west but pretty normal in Thailand. The nice example of asian elephant, is an ancient symbol of knowledge and powerful tool to protect the country.

On your knees and thankful. To understand this you have to look for reasons in Thailand&#39;s history. Thailand is one of the few places in Asia that managed to avoid all foreign domination thanks to a rather en-lighted international policy by the Thai Royals back in the colonialism times. It does not sound strange that young people are thankful still today, look what happened to neighboring countries...

It&#39;s 5th decenmber. Many hotels and resorts make a little altar, on the road side outside the entrance, with photos, flags and neon lights to honor the King&#39;s birthday.

Even in rural Thailand, in the middle of nowhere, you can see big yellow billboards with Royal advertising.
