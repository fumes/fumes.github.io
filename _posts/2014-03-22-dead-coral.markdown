The <a title="read about the coral triangle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle" target="_blank">abundance</a> of coral types and the shapes of <a title="more infos on coral reef" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef" target="_blank">coral reefs</a> they form is quite surprising.

The <a title="The Structure and Distribution of Cora Reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_and_Distribution_of_Coral_Reefs" target="_blank">structure</a>, the form, its strength are all an <a title="watch a movie about Raja Ampat, Indonesia - Scuba diving in paradise" href="http://youtu.be/dMldSFwXTfU" target="_blank">astonishing</a> architecture work.

When it naturally dies is crushed by the sea to form sand. Also <a title="read about coral bleaching" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching" target="_blank">pollution</a>, anchoring, bomb fishing and climate change contribute to its <a title="Aquaculture is showing promise as a potentially effective tool for restoring coral reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_aquaculture" target="_blank">destruction</a>. 

All the pieces of coral shown here have been collected in the Tuban beach near the airport of Bali, <a title="read more on Southeast Asian coral reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_coral_reefs" target="_blank">Indonesia</a>.
