We all stick to habits we have developed while growing up. I doesn't matter if those routines are not appropriate anymore. We also describe things mostly only as we have been told to call them.

Genova, an Italian harbour city was once a city state, an independent republic based on maritime trade. 500 years later, it is just a forgotten provincial town of little relevance. Genova decline is still on. Its population, which reached 1 million about 30 years ago, totals now to only about 700.000.

People perception and customs sometimes don't quite follow reality changes. Most of us just keep on repeating the past. Even when past conditions are not here anymore. We call it tradition and it's perceived as safer than striving for better. Because it always worked like that, we tend to suppose it will always will.

People from Genova still live "la Dolce Vita". And they're still very "Superb" about it.

So la dolce vita, the sweet life, what is it? See for yourself, today it's about separation and solitude, decadence and stubbornness... and a quite generous natural environment.

1 Million inhabitants 30 years ago, Genova counts now about 700.00 people. Kids are few. People no have time for them.
When they happen to arrive, kids are raised to be diligent taxi customers, used to buckle up and be quiet since young age.

Packing up homes was convenient when pirate assaults where an everyday possibility. Easier to defend the town. Perched between steep mountains and the Med sea, this coast is no easy land.

Locals here are mostly elders and retired.

Those youngs who hadn't left yet, have plenty of cheap summer fun. The sea still play a big role in people lives here.

Efficiency is not from here. Can have it only if you can afford it. And it has to be imported from somewhere else...

Most people must just put up with a simple life. What else to do...

Sometimes it looks like a sad life, even if it's actually pretty good.

Fact is that problems don't go away by simply ignoring them.
