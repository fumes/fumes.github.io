Why is it that many old people in western societies look all but happy? Has it to do with separation and loneliness? Is it the price to pay for what they call progress? Has it to do with the individualistic imperative?

With all these unanswered questions in mind have a look at these quite representative shots by Luci. She loves to travel in South East Asia and engage with local communities.

From the desert of Rajasthan in India to the remote islands of Mentawai, Sumba and Bali in Indonesia she has met many old people who are actively participating in their village life, surrounded by loving families... and they definitely can unravel the secret of being happy at an old age.
