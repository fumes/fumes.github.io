What we eat is completely related to the culture with grow up with. Few reflect on the impact for the planet or for other living creatures that our diet involves.

While modern media convinced us to eat artificial food like margarine or corn flakes, and they put a lot of effort suppling you with reasons, few reflect on the actual impact that our food is having on our body, our performances and the way we feel.

We mostly swallow the reasons that came with the food advertising while we rarely stop and think, let it alone test if the food is actually doing any good to us. This happens because it's complicated to test, it involves abstaining from eating certain food and find a way to register the test of the food we put in our mouth.

We also delegate to our culture the reasoning behind eating certain foods or say no thanks. When we are surrounded by people who feed on certain stuff it becomes normal and accepted that you will eat that too, like a shortcut to thinking and reasoning about it.

We are what we eat as individuals and also as societies and this definitely shapes our everyday actions and thinking. So think before you eat... and also after, it might improve your life.

So here is a visual stimuli to enquire further on customary food habits. All shots are from the Tomohon market in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, where they got quite unusual food gourmets sources. Bon app√©tit!
