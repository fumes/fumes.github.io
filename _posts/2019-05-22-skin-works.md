excerpt: Skin Works is a new black-and-white work by Rokma. While your summer might be pink, we emotionally feel black and white. Shades of grey smoothly attract. Not surviving alone in the jungle, we are driven to seek contact. We see with our hands. We feel the importance. Gravitating culturally around beauty, skin works exploring the vibe.
