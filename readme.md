##what?^#@_Fumes is an online photography magazine broadcasting human interest stories mainly from south east asia._ _Fumes project was started by two photographers. A metaphor to play with, delivering ideas via images.__Fumes is now refactored. Articles are structured as `photographer`/`curator`   symbiotic relationships.
