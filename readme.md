##what?^#@
_Fumes is an online photography magazine broadcasting human interest stories mainly from south east asia._ 
_Fumes project was started by two photographers. A metaphor to play with, delivering ideas via images._
_Fumes is now refactored. Articles are structured as `photographer`/`curator`   symbiotic relationships. This hopefully will bloom greener fumes soon..._


## Structure
- Real master live in the ` source ` branch, 
- Compiled jekyll ` _site ` (yup, it still needs plugins..) in ` master ` branch


## To do

##### Urgent:
- figure out github 
- change domain pointer 
- propagation

##### Sometime soon:
- open graph
- twitter cards
- automatic rake publish script
- improve gulp tasks
- use authors.yml

##### One day:
- https
- install service workers
